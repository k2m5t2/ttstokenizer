// idea: cmudict_fast and grapheme_to_phoneme libraries output in different structures
// i want to make sure that my post-processing steps are good enough!

// get a word pool 

// run it through both models

// output results in an easy-to-digest way (report!?)

// including some statistical metrics & information about particularly wrong words
